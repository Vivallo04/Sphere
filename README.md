## Known issues
- When trying to compile "hello.crpt" it will only compile the frist PRINT statement
- Parser.java line 296 is commented out since it give an error ("Expected NEWLINE, got EOF")
- Lexer.java line 164 does not support `current position + 1` that's why the `+ 1` was removed 

Any other questions can be made to my email? :)
